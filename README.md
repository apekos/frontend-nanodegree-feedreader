## Description

This is a Udacity Front End Nanodegree project.
We were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and had to write some test suits. 
[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) was already included!


## Run

Download the zip file or clone via Github and then open the Ã¬ndex.html file.


## Instructions
* On the bottom of the page you can see the tests that are passed.
* If you want to add more tests, open feedreader.js, which is located in the jasmine folder.
